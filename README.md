Implementation of ML/QF algorithms, including:

- PCA Color Augmentation: a data augmentation technique widely used in image recognition
- Recommendation System: 
	- 1) similiarity-based recommender
	- 2) collaborative filitering (Tensorflow implementation)
- Dynamic Fama-French with Kalman filter: recover latent alpha & factor loadings based on observed returns
