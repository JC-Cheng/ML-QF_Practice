Implementation of ML/QF algorithms, including:

- PCA Color Augmentation: a data augmentation technique widely used in image recognition
- Recommendation System: 1) similiarity-based recommender and 2) collaborative filitering (Tensorflow implementation)
- Dynamic CAPM with Kalman filter: recover latent Alpha & Beta based on observed returns
