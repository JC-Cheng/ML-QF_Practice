# Machine Learning & Quantitative Finance
Implementation of ML/QF algorithms, including:

- Deep Mixture Density Networks: deep MDN model implemented by Tensorflow
- Dynamic Fama-French with Kalman filter: recovering latent alpha & factor loadings based on observed returns
- Multi-Asset Momentum: extracting momentum signals from various asset class and test with different strategies
- PCA Color Augmentation: a data augmentation technique widely used in image recognition
- Quantile Regression: estimating q% quantile of asset return
- Recommendation System: 
	- 1) similiarity-based recommender
	- 2) collaborative filitering (Tensorflow implementation)
- RNN Queue Imbalance: predicting next timestamp bid/ask direction with limit order book status
